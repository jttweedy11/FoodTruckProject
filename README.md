# Food Truck Application
The Food Truck application allows the user to enter information about their favorite food trucks and rate them accordingly. Once the user enters their Food Trucks, up to five, they will be presented with the following options:
1 - Print out all food trucks entered.
2 - Calculate and print out the average rating of the Food Trucks entered.
3 - Print out the highest rated Food Truck entered.
4 - Exit the menu and end the program.

### Technologies used:
Constructors
Methods
Passing Variables
While loops
Conditionals
auto-increments

### Lessons Learned:
I experienced issues with the passing the rates correctly into the arrays as well as some casting issues with calculating the average rate.  I initially utilized for loops for some of the methods that were replaced with while loops as they seemed to produce better results.
### Description:
This application takes in input from the user and creates "FoodTruck" objects and stores them in arrays of arrays and makes certain metrics available to the user. Various constructors and methods are used throughout the program to interact with the user's input and provide the data required as output while maintaining the private nature of certain attributes.
